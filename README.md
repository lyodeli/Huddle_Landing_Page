## MY PROCESS

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This was my first time building a site from scratch "on my own" since I've started a more focused learning. I loved the process and was happy with how quickly I was able to find answers to my questions online. I moved through the project thoughtfully, really thinking about why I was choosing a particular method, and how everything would ultimately fit together as a whole.

Overall, I got a better feel for semantic HTML and using flexbox. I also learned how to stack icons from fontawesome.com.

### Continued development

I'm moving into my next project by planning on getting more practice with HTML and CSS, but also adding in Javascript in some form or another. I also want to spend time creating a tablet-sized CSS as the flow from desktop to mobile here felt very jarring.

### Useful resources
